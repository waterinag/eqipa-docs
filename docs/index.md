# EQIPA – Evapotranspiration-based Quick Irrigation Performance Assessment Platform


## 🌐 Overview


The **EQIPA** (Evapotranspiration-based Quick Irrigation Performance Assessment) platform – [eqipa.waterinag.org](https://eqipa.waterinag.org) – is a powerful, web-based geospatial application built to evaluate the performance of irrigation schemes across India.


EQIPA platform leverages open-source remote sensing datasets from multiple sources to generate Irrigation Performance Assessment (IPA) reports
for any selected command area across India. The platform is highly interective where users
can select the area of interest, season and data sources for Evapotranspitation and rainfall.
There are more than 2000 irrigation commands ingested into the platform ready to analyse
and can be filtered state-wise. The user can select the area of interest from these ingested
schemes and the platform will provide with a detailed report on spatial assessments of land
&amp; water resources for the selected scheme. The reports are generated in both pdf and web
HTML formats (unique url) for a selected year and season (user-specified start and end
month). The platform is entirely developed using open source libraries and database in a
modular structure which makes it highly customizable and transferrable.
