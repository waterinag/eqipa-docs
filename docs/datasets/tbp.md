# Actual Evapotranspiration
Total Biomass Production (TBP) is defined as the sum of the above-ground dry matter produced for a given year. TBP is calculated from Net Primary Production (NPP). TBP is expressed in kgDM/ha/day, and has thus different biomass units compared to NPP, with 1 gC/m2/day (NPP) = 22.222 kgDM/ha/day (DMP).

For further information on the methodology read the WaPOR documentation available at: https://bitbucket.org/cioapps/wapor-et-look/wiki/Home

## üìå Data Processing Summary

1. Monthly WaPOR L1 v3 NPP (300m) maps have been downloaded from WaPOR.
2. EMonthly TBP maps are calculated as = Monthly NPP √ó Scale Factor (0.001) √ó Unit Conversion Factor (22.222). See the scale factor for each WaPOR product here: https://data.apps.fao.org/wapor
3. Annual TBP maps is computed for all crop years by aggregating monthly TBP maps from June to May, covering crop years 2018-19 to 2022-23.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Python Script: Download Monthly NPP (WaPOR v3)

This script downloads monthly NPP GeoTIFFs from FAO's WaPOR v3 Google-hosted URLs.


```python
