- Powerful Analysis Tools: Ideal for advanced geospatial modeling and automation.
- Cross-platform Compatibility: Available on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Integration Ready: Works well with QGIS, Python, PostgreSQL/PostGIS, and other open-source tools.
- Custom Scripting: Automate workflows using Bash or Python (PyGRASS).


### Key Features
- Raster and vector data support with a rich set of analytical tools
- Region and mask management for precise control over analysis extents
- Time-series data management and analysis
- Advanced hydrological and terrain analysis modules
- 3D visualization and volume modeling
- Flexible data import/export options
