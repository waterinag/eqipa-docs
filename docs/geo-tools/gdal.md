# üåç GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library)

**GDAL** is an open-source library used in GIS (Geographic Information Systems) for reading, writing, and processing raster and vector geospatial data. It acts as a translator between different geospatial data formats and is widely used in software like QGIS, GRASS GIS, and many Python-based GIS workflows.

### Key Features 
- Supports 100+ raster formats (GeoTIFF, NetCDF, HDF, etc.) and vector formats (Shapefile, GeoJSON, KML, etc.)
- Powerful command-line tools (like gdalwarp, gdal_translate, ogr2ogr) for data conversion, reprojection, clipping, mosaicking, and more.
- Allows raster and vector data transformation, such as projection changes, resampling, and format conversion.
- Well-supported Python bindings for automation and integration with geospatial workflows.
- Extensively used in remote sensing, cartography, and spatial analysis.
